# Ruby Geocaching libraries

This code has to be cleaned up and refactored seriously!

This repository provides ways to copy geocaches offline (using a DB) and generating files for offline caching (gpx, pdf, txt, etc)

I use this in combination with Dropbox / Dropsync and OsmAnd to have a complete offline digital geocaching setup on the go.
